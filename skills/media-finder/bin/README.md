# yandeximages/search — OpenCLI adapter

## Install (local adapter, auto-detected)

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.opencli/clis/yandeximages
cp search.js search.test.js ~/.opencli/clis/yandeximages/
```

OpenCLI's discovery (`dist/src/discovery.js`) filesystem-scans `~/.opencli/clis/**/*.js`
for files that call `cli(...)` from `@jackwener/opencli/registry` — no manifest edit
needed. It also auto-creates a `node_modules/@jackwener/opencli` symlink under
`~/.opencli/` the first time it runs, so the import resolves.

**Important:** unlike built-in adapters, `search.js` here is fully self-contained
(no `../_shared/*` import). I initially wrote it importing a helper module the way
the built-in `duckduckgo`/`douban` adapters do, installed it at
`~/.opencli/clis/yandeximages/search.js`, and ran `opencli list` — which surfaced
this real error:

```
⚠  Failed to load module /root/.opencli/clis/yandeximages/search.js:
   Cannot find module '/root/.opencli/clis/_shared/search-adapter.js'
```

That shared helper directory only exists inside the *installed npm package*
(`node_modules/@jackwener/opencli/clis/_shared/`), not under your user
`~/.opencli/clis/` tree. So local/plugin adapters can't rely on it — I inlined
the handful of helper functions directly into `search.js` instead. This version
is what's in this folder.

## Confirmed working (actually run, not just written)

I installed `@jackwener/opencli@1.8.6` from npm, placed this file at
`~/.opencli/clis/yandeximages/search.js`, and ran the real CLI:

```
$ opencli list | grep -A1 yandeximages
  yandeximages
    search [public] — Search Yandex Images by keyword

$ opencli validate yandeximages/search
opencli validate: PASS
Checked 1 command(s)
Errors: 0  Warnings: 0

$ npx vitest run search.test.js
✓ clis/yandeximages/search.test.js (9 tests)
Tests  9 passed (9)
```

If it's missing on your machine instead:
- Run `opencli doctor` — the file may have a syntax error the scanner silently skipped.
- Check `OPENCLI_VERBOSE=1 opencli list` for discovery warnings (this is how the
  `_shared` import bug above was actually caught).

## Verify it actually works against the live site

I could not test this against yandex.com from my sandbox (no network egress to it),
so the DOM extraction is written against Yandex's historically documented
`.serp-item[data-bem]` markup, with a fallback scan for inline JSON state. Before
trusting it:

```bash
opencli browser recon analyze "https://yandex.com/images/search?text=cats"
opencli browser recon verify yandeximages/search
opencli yandeximages search "cats" --limit 5 -f json
```

If `recon analyze` shows different markup, or reports a captcha/WAF vendor
(Yandex's SmartCaptcha is the likely candidate), the `func` in `search.js` will
need its selectors updated — the extractor functions (`buildSerpItemExtractorJs`,
`buildInlineStateExtractorJs`) are isolated so you can patch just the DOM query.

## Run tests

```bash
cd ~/.opencli/clis/yandeximages
npx vitest run search.test.js
```

## Usage

```bash
opencli yandeximages search "golden retriever puppies" --limit 20 -f table
opencli yandeximages search "golden retriever puppies" --page 1 -f json
```
